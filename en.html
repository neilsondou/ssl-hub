              This library has the same nature as the National Philosophy and Social Sciences Documentation Center and
              various privately maintained electronic libraries established by the Academy of Social Sciences, but this
              is not a commercial project.
              The team that maintains this database is committed to collecting various academic or non-academic content
              in the fields of politics, culture, and history. This content includes but is not limited to various
              academic journals under the social science category,
              Essays, monographs, novels, documentary literature, various historical materials, and popular readers.

          UDR (Uniform Document Retention) is a format developed by this library team, which aims to efficiently
          integrate documents of different formats for encryption, fast compression, and efficient sharing. By using
          extraction methods such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, various documents (such as PDF,
          Word, various e-books, etc.) are converted into plain text data, and then the text data is structured and
          formatted to form a unified data set and stored in a large file.

        <p>As mentioned in the introduction at the top of the page, the content we include includes but is not limited
          to various academic journals under the category of social sciences,
          Essays, monographs, novels, documentary literature, various historical materials, and popular readers. We do
          not have any political stance on the specific selection of which documents to include, and prefer to include
          more professional content. This means For example, writings about <u>Marxism, anarchism, and philosophical
            categories other than political philosophy and analytical philosophy</u> may have an empty ideological color
          and are separated from specific academic research or have no research value. Documents on disciplines and
          schools of practical significance are not included in this database. You can find them in <a
            href="http://lib.ssl-hub.one/">Online Library</a> Select submit your own document at the bottom of the page.
        </p>
        <p>The sources of documents currently in the library are: IPFS network, Open Knowledge Sharing Network (ocss),
          Cambridge
          Core journal database, original seed bookstore, zlibrary, National Philosophy and Social Sciences
          Documentation Center, Yuyue Library, Resilio Sync shared resources, cultural bookstore, etc. </p>
        <p>Our next step is to try our best to include in this library documents on various topics that are the same as
          those collected and preserved in various online libraries on the Internet (such as Anna’s Archive). </p>

    <h5>What I want to say
    </h5>
    <hr>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
        <p>As <u>“The development of Chinese social sciences, including political science, is based on the premise of
            being involved in the global knowledge system. The mature foreign discipline system
            and discourse hegemony, and the recolonization process of the knowledge world, pose a challenge to Chinese
            social sciences committed to independent development. Under this situation
            , the coexistence and collision of specialized knowledge and holistic knowledge are inevitable. The
            confrontation between the two, which overlaps and sharpens each other, determines the direction of the
            reshaping of Chinese social sciences and political science disciplines.”</a></u>
          As mentioned in the article, the influence of foreign social science academic systems on domestic higher
          education and social science research began with the reform and opening up, and Deng Xiaoping’s proposal of
          “make-up lessons” in 1979.
          And now China still has a long way to go to build a complete academic system that is in line with
          international standards. Perhaps the obstacle is not the academic atmosphere of colleges and universities and
          the ability of scholars to accept new things,
          The main reason may be that the domestic academic environment is not open enough. Due to various pressures, we
          are unable to conduct in-depth and localized discussions on various foreign theories, and we cannot go too far
          in the depth of research. For example, the series of theoretical frameworks of "comparative political science"
          cannot fully explain Chinese politics, and scholars who study Chinese politics have not been able to bring a
          big enough impact to comparative political science from the "field" of China. ”</u>
          Chinese social scientists cannot improve their own academic system based on national conditions in this
          environment. So far, they have only improved their own rhetoric system, which, except for propaganda, cannot
          play any role in academia or reality.
        </p>
        <p>Under various restrictions, whether we are scholars studying related disciplines or ordinary people, if we
          want to have sufficient knowledge and understanding of our country and society,
          and then promote the progress of civilization in our own way, whether it is to achieve political democracy,
          personal freedom, and social rule of law, to achieve our political civilization and modernization in a larger
          sense,
          the best way to participate in political practice and political process is to read. In most of the disciplines
          we call science, especially social sciences,
          if we want to conduct quantitative to qualitative research, thus forming a complete academic system, or just
          want to expand our knowledge and deepen our understanding of social operation,
          the cornerstone of this process is sufficient reading.
        </p>
        <p>Our vision is to establish an open and shared library of sufficient size in the future, which will be
          provided free of charge to anyone who needs it, in order to promote the above-mentioned progress.
